DOC STORE APPROACH

YAML / JSON / EDN encoded files:

---
id: "123-456-789"
key: 123 // comment
key: "string"
key:
  - "array"
  - "of"
  - "values"
key:
  embedded: "object"
---


can be arbitrarily stored in folders
could have folder names "mean" something (ex. type)
could have file names "mean" something (ex. id, slug)
can have data re: multiple entities in a file (delimited by ---)
can have data re: same entity across files
can have embedded entries

- no versioning/time
+ can use multiple serialization methods
+ standard serialization / well known
